Here you will find 2 forms, one that as been built with a normal class component and the other one using react Hooks. 

## How to use

In the project directory, you can run:

To install all the dependencies and get you going

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### set you your .env 
(note - I had previously committed my key :( but now is changed)

REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_API_KEY = your_airtable_api_key
REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = your_airtable_base_id
